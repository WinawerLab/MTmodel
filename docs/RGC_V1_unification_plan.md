This document is a **self-contained handoff**. If you are a fresh agent picking
this up (e.g. on the laptop after a `git pull`), read this top-to-bottom before
touching code. It records what we established, the decisions we made, and the
concrete next steps. It supplements `AGENTS.md` (which documents the *current*
code); this document describes the *direction we are moving toward*.

---

## 1. Goal (unchanged)

Add a biologically-motivated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer before V1 so the
model can simulate optic-neuritis impairments, while keeping healthy-condition
V1/MT responses close to the legacy Simoncelli–Heeger (SH) model.

## 2. What this session established

### 2.1 The two-view V1 receptive field (validated exactly)

A V1 neuron's linear RF can be viewed two equivalent ways, and we can build both
analytically from `pars`:

- **RGC-referred**: `RF_rgc` is `Y × X × nClass` — for each RGC class (temporal
  channel) `k`, the neuron's spatial weighting of that class:
  `RF_rgc(:,:,k) = Σ_{n: torder(n)=k} w(n) · yfilt_n ⊗ xfilt_n`.
- **Stimulus-referred**: `RF_stim` is `Y × X × lag` —
  `RF_stim(:,:,τ) = Σ_k RF_rgc(:,:,k) · tf_k(τ)`, i.e. the class maps carry the
  temporal kernels.

Here `w = shSwts(direction)` (10-vector), `xfilt/yfilt = v1SpatialFilters(:,order+1)`,
`tf_k = v1TemporalFilters(:,k+1)`. There are **28** V1 neurons, **9-tap** filters,
so `RF_rgc` is 9×9×4 and `RF_stim` is 9×9×9.

**Verification:** feeding a 9×9×9 stimulus (single output location) through the
real model and comparing to the analytic RF gives max error **6e-16** across all
28 neurons. Script: `explore/showV1RfDerivative.m`.

### 2.2 'derivative' and 'fourPop' are the SAME machinery (validated)

The `fourPop` path (`shModelV1LinearFromRgc` + `shFitRgcV1Weights`) is already the
*general* model: 4 RGC classes × 10 spatial-derivative read-outs = 40 features →
fitted weights → V1. `derivative` mode is the special case where the RGC classes
are (delta spatial RF, SH temporal-derivative kernels) and the weights are
available *analytically* (`shSwts`) instead of fitted.

**Experiment (`explore/unifyDerivativeVsFourPop.m`):** run the identical
40-feature projection + ridge fit, swapping only the RGC classes.

| RGC classes | held-out test corr vs legacy | NRMSE |
|---|---|---|
| derivative (delta × SH temporal-derivative) | **0.99991** (1.0 modulo ridge λ) | 0.0015 |
| fourPop (DoG × biphasic) | 0.693 | 0.079 |

Cross-check: the derivative 40-feature projection *contains the exact 10-column
structured basis* as a sub-selection (err = 0). **Conclusion: the two "modes" are
one implementation with different RGC-class parameters.** They should be collapsed.

### 2.3 Clarified the two levels (important — we confused these mid-session)

- **RGC classes** = populations, each = one spatial RF + one temporal kernel.
  There are **4** (both modes). The RGC layer emits 4 channel images `[Y X T]`.
- **V1 read-out** = spatial-derivative filters V1 applies to each RGC image. The
  "4/3/2/1", "10", and "40" are all counts of *V1 read-out filters*, never RGC
  classes.
- The SH basis constraint is **total order `t+x+y = 3`** (not spatial `x+y=3`).
  The 10 basis functions are the `(t,x,y)` triples summing to 3; grouped by
  temporal order they are 4/3/2/1. This is the **diagonal** of the 4×10
  (class × spatial-read-out) grid; `fourPop` fills the whole grid, `derivative`
  uses only the diagonal.

### 2.4 Temporal-frequency coverage: biological kernels vs SH (the MT concern)

SH's four temporal kernels are successive temporal derivatives (0–3 zero
crossings) that **tile** temporal frequency; peak TF marches 0 → 0.129 → 0.178 →
0.215 cyc/frame. The biological difference-of-gamma kernels currently in the code
(only **2 distinct**: fast/slow, reused across ON/OFF) peak at only 0.105 (fast)
and 0.021 (slow) cyc/frame — i.e. they cover **only the lower half** of SH's
range (≈ order 0–1). Kling (2020) Fig. 4A confirms all four human RGC classes are
monophasic-to-biphasic; there is **no single-RGC counterpart** to SH's tri-/quad-
phasic (order 2–3, high-TF) channels.

**Why it matters:** SH's V1 population deliberately tiles a *range* of SF/TF
(narrowband individually) so MT can build **speed tuning** by pooling across it.
Biological kernels alone truncate that range → truncated MT speed range. This is
a concern separate from direction selectivity. Script:
`explore/compareTemporalKernels.m`.

### 2.5 Adelson & Bergen (1985) — how DS is built, and the minimal basis

- Direction selectivity is a **cross-term**: an oriented (space-time inseparable)
  RF = (spatial phase A × temporal kernel 1) ± (spatial phase B × temporal
  kernel 2). "A single separable filter can never be directionally selective;
  the minimum is a sum of two separable filters."
- **Reconciliation of the "clean" idea:** V1 = a *time-invariant* spatial
  weighting of RGC outputs IS sufficient for DS, **provided the weighting differs
  per RGC class**. No temporal filter is needed between RGC and V1; the RGC
  classes supply the temporal diversity, V1 supplies class-specific spatial
  weights, DS emerges from the cross-term.
- Minimal basis for DS: **2 temporal × 2 spatial phases** (not 10 per class). The
  fourPop 4×10 grid is over-complete. Temporal variety should live in the
  classes; V1 reads each through only a **small number** of spatial phases.

### 2.6 Chariker & Shapley (2021 theory / 2022 params) — biological DS mechanism

DS in macaque 4Cα (magno/**parasol** input) arises from two ingredients:
1. **Spatial wiring:** ON and OFF fed to **spatially offset** subregions.
2. **Temporal difference:** ON pathway **delayed ~9–11 ms** (they use 10 ms)
   relative to OFF (Mechanism #1, a pure time shift; Mechanism #2 additionally
   reshapes the ON kernel). Sum → spatiotemporal inseparability → DS, **broadband
   in SF and TF**.

Their kernel (magno): `K(t) = t⁶/τ₀⁷·e^(−t/τ₀) − t⁶/τ₁⁷·e^(−t/τ₁)`, τ₀=3.66 ms,
τ₁=7.16 ms, power **n=6**, positive→negative crossover at 36 ms, peak TF ≈ 10 Hz.

This is Adelson–Bergen realized biologically: the two temporal phases = OFF
(early) & ON (late); the spatial phase = the ON/OFF subregion offset. It maps
directly onto §2.5's "class-specific spatial weighting of temporally-distinct
channels."

### 2.7 Prototype result: delay gives narrowband DS; quadrature gives broadband

`explore/prototypeOnOffDelayDS.m` is a 1D linear simulation of the mechanism (OFF
subregion at 0, ON subregion offset by `d`, ON kernel modified; measure F1 to
gratings drifting both ways across TF). Findings:

- **Both ingredients are required.** DSI is *exactly 0* when the ON delay OR the
  spatial offset is removed (controls). DS is a genuine cross-term.
- **A pure ON time delay gives frequency-dependent DS** (DSI rises with TF,
  strong only at high TF) — matching Chariker Mechanism #1 ("DS at TFs above
  ~4 Hz"). In this linear model the DS is *kernel-shape-independent*: parasol and
  midget give identical DSI. The kernel sets the response *passband*, the ON/OFF
  phase sets DS.
- **A constant-phase (≈90° quadrature) ON/OFF kernel difference gives broadband
  DS** (DSI roughly flat across TF; parasol quad mean 0.76, midget 0.58),
  reproducing Chariker's broadband-DS signature (their Mechanism #2). The exact
  Hilbert quad is acausal; biology approximates it with a *shaped causal* ON
  kernel.

**Design consequence:** implement the ON/OFF difference as a **kernel-shape
(phase) difference approximating quadrature**, not merely a fixed time lag — a
lag alone only buys high-TF DS. Parasol/midget kernels then set the TF passbands;
together they broaden TF coverage for MT.

## 3. Decisions made this session

1. **Keep the SH analytic derivative basis** as the healthy-baseline path (it is
   exact and provides the SF/TF range MT needs for speed tuning).
2. **Unify** `derivative` and `fourPop` into one class-based implementation; they
   become *parameter presets*, not code branches (see §2.2).
3. **Adopt an ON/OFF kernel-shape (phase) difference as the temporal-phase source
   for DS** (Chariker/Shapley), rather than downstream lag-copy channels. Apply it
   for **two class types — midgets and parasols** — giving ON/OFF × midget/parasol
   with distinct midget vs parasol kernels. **Refined by the §2.7 prototype:** the
   ON/OFF difference should approximate a constant-phase (~90° quadrature) causal
   kernel difference (Chariker Mechanism #2) for *broadband* DS — a pure ~10 ms
   delay alone (Mechanism #1) only yields high-TF DS. The schema should therefore
   carry a per-class ON/OFF kernel *pair* (or a phase parameter), not just a
   scalar delay.
4. **The ON-vs-OFF spatial offset lives in the V1 read-out** and is *where DS is
   actually assembled* — design it explicitly, not as an accident of the
   derivative read-out.
5. **The MT/TF-range gap is separate from DS.** The high-TF (order 2–3) channels
   have no single-RGC counterpart and remain *synthesized* (keep SH basis for the
   healthy baseline; optionally build via multi-timescale + delays later).
6. If explicit ON/OFF spatial-offset wiring becomes cumbersome, fall back to a
   clean Adelson–Bergen skeleton (even/odd spatial × 2 temporal phases).

## 4. Next steps (do these next)

**(2) Write the unified `pars.rgc.classes` schema.** Each class entry carries:
- `label` / `type` (e.g. 'onParasol'), `polarity` ('on'/'off'),
- `temporalKernel` (vector) and/or its generating params,
- `onOffDelayFrames` (≈10 ms → frames; ON delayed relative to OFF),
- `spatialRF` (delta for the analytic preset; DoG for biological),
- `spatialReadoutOrders` (which V1 spatial-derivative orders this class feeds —
  singleton `{3−k}` for the derivative preset's diagonal; `{0..3}` for fourPop),
- and, for DS, the ON-vs-OFF **spatial offset** used by the V1 read-out.

Presets that *populate* this field (not code branches):
`shRgcClassesDerivative(pars)` (analytic, exact) and a biological
`shRgcClassesMidgetParasol(pars)`. Then: **one** forward function, **one** weight
step (analytic for the derivative preset, fit otherwise), **one** RF extractor +
viewer (`shV1Rf` / `shShowV1Rf`, class-agnostic — the two-view viz in
`explore/showV1RfDerivative.m`).

**Refactor progress (incremental, keeping the oracle green):**

- **Increment 1 — DONE (2026-07-10).** Schema + generic forward for the
  derivative preset. New files: `pars/shRgcClass.m` (class constructor),
  `pars/shRgcClassesDerivative.m` (derivative preset), and
  `model/innerworkings/shModelV1LinearFromClasses.m` (the single class-based
  forward; `combine='steer'` for analytic SH steering, `combine='weights'` for a
  fitted matrix). Verified to reproduce the existing derivative path *and* legacy
  **exactly (err = 0)** — see `explore/verifyClassPathDerivative.m` and the new
  `tests/testClassPathDerivative.m` (now in `runAllTests`, 10/10 pass). Nothing in
  the existing dispatch was changed, so the default path is untouched.
- **Increment 2 — DONE (2026-07-10).** Biological preset on the class path. The
  feature builder was factored out to `model/innerworkings/shClassV1Basis.m`
  (shared by the forward and the fitter); its `localClassChannel` now implements
  the DoG spatial RF + ON/OFF half-wave rectification, and the ON/OFF `readoutOffset`
  is applied (a `circshift` of the class channel). New:
  `pars/shQuadratureKernel.m` (90-deg Hilbert phase shift, the ON/OFF constant-
  phase partner), `pars/shRgcClassesMidgetParasol.m` (ON/OFF x midget/parasol with
  quadrature ON kernels + spatial offset -> 4 classes x 10 read-outs = 40
  features), and `help/shFitClassV1Weights.m` (ridge fit for `combine='weights'`).
  Verified end-to-end (`explore/verifyClassPathBiological.m`, `tests/testClassPathBiological.m`,
  11/11 pass): held-out legacy-V1 correlation ~0.70, on par with the old fourPop
  ceiling (~0.69), finite. As expected, the quadrature aids DS but cannot recover
  the missing high-TF orders, so legacy reconstruction still caps ~0.7. Existing
  dispatch remains unchanged.
- **Increment 3a — DONE (2026-07-10).** Dispatch switch. `shModelV1Linear`'s
  default derivative path now routes through `shModelV1LinearFromClasses`; `shPars`
  populates `pars.rgc.classes` (derivative preset) + `pars.rgc.combine='steer'` so
  the class parameterization is live. Added the 4th (`resdirs`) output to the class
  forward. The legacy per-channel lesioning hook (`pars.rgc.derivative.channelGain`)
  is honored by mapping it onto the classes' per-class gains in the dispatch.
  Verified exact vs legacy incl. the `resdirs` output (err = 0); `testClassPathDerivative`
  extended to cover it; 11/11 pass. `'fourPop'` mode still uses its old path.
- **Increment 3b — DONE (2026-07-10).** Class-agnostic RF viewer. `help/shV1Rf.m`
  computes a V1 neuron's RF referred two ways from `pars.rgc.classes` (RGC-referred
  per-class spatial maps `RFrgc` [fsz x fsz x nClass]; stimulus-referred linear
  space-time RF `RFstim`), for either `steer` or `weights` combine.
  `show/shShowV1Rf.m` draws both figures. Verified: derivative `RFstim` reproduces
  the model to ~6e-16; biological preset renders per-class maps + distinct ON/OFF
  quadrature kernels. `tests/testV1Rf.m` added; 12/12 pass.
  (`explore/showV1RfDerivative.m` is now superseded by these.)
- **Increment 3c — DONE (2026-07-12).**
  - **(2026-07-10) optic-neuritis impairment on the class path.** Impairment
    logic (spatial amplitude deficit + integer-frame delay) was extracted to
    the shared `model/innerworkings/shApplyRgcImpairment.m`, used by both
    `shClassV1Basis` (class path) and `shModelRgc` (fourPop) so they stay
    consistent. `shClassV1Basis` applies it to each class channel. Verified: a
    uniform 0.5 amplitude map scales the linear V1 response by exactly 0.5;
    localized/delay deficits change the output and stay finite; non-integer
    delay errors. `tests/testImpairment.m` added; 13/13 pass.
  - **(2026-07-12) `'fourPop'` migrated to a class preset.** New
    `pars/shRgcClassesFourPop.m` builds the 4 base classes (onFast/offFast/
    onSlow/offSlow, DoG spatial RF + causal bi-gamma temporal kernel) plus
    optional lag classes (`onFastLag`/etc., built as the same class with a
    zero-padded kernel -- a post-hoc D-frame delay of a causally-filtered
    channel is algebraically identical to convolving with the kernel preceded
    by D zero taps) whenever `pars.rgc.temporal.fastLag`/`slowLag` > 0. Only
    `pars.rgc.onOffSignSplit = 'contrast'` and `pars.rgc.temporal.mode =
    'causal'` are supported (the only settings exercised elsewhere). Verified
    to reproduce the legacy fourPop feature basis (`shModelV1LinearFromRgc` /
    `shModelRgc`) **exactly (err = 0)**, including lagged channels, once
    columns are permuted for the two paths' different (but equivalent)
    read-out block ordering -- see `explore/verifyClassPathFourPop.m` and
    `tests/testClassPathFourPop.m` (now in `runAllTests`, 14/14 pass).
    `shModelV1Linear`'s `'fourpop'` dispatch now routes through
    `shModelV1LinearFromClasses` (mirroring `'derivative'`); a new
    `pars.rgc.classesMode` field records which preset built `pars.rgc.classes`
    so switching `pars.rgc.mode` on an already-built `pars` rebuilds the right
    preset instead of silently reusing stale classes from the other mode.
    `pars/shPars.m` now fits fourPop's `v1Weights` via `shFitClassV1Weights`
    (not `shFitRgcV1Weights`). All dependent tooling migrated to the class
    path: `help/shCalibrateRgcLayer.m`, `help/shSweepRgcTemporalPars.m`,
    `help/shTestRgcV1Corr.m`, `show/shShowRgcAndV1Comparison.m`,
    `show/shShowRgcAndMtComparison.m`, `show/shShowRgcV1ReceptiveFields.m`
    (including fixing its basis-column-label mapping to the class path's
    ascending spatial-order convention). **Behavior change:** the class
    path's `combine='weights'` has no default (unfitted) fallback -- unlike
    legacy `shModelV1LinearFromRgc`, which applied `shRgcV1Weights` to the
    first 4 channels when `v1Weights` was empty. fourPop mode now always
    requires a fit; `tests/testRgcVsLegacyCorr.m` and
    `help/shTestRgcV1Corr.m` were updated to expect an error instead of a
    silent fallback.
  - **Twin forwards retired.** `shModelV1LinearFromRgcDerivative` (already
    dead -- no dispatcher used it) is deleted; `explore/unifyDerivativeVsFourPop.m`
    updated to drop its cross-check (superseded by `testClassPathDerivative`'s
    exact err=0 guardrail). `help/shFitRgcV1Weights.m` is deleted (no callers
    remained after the tooling migration). `model/innerworkings/shModelV1LinearFromRgc.m`
    is **kept, but retired from the live dispatch** -- it is now only the
    independent reference oracle for `tests/testClassPathFourPop.m`'s exact-
    equivalence guardrail (analogous to how the legacy no-RGC path is kept as
    the oracle for the derivative preset). `model/innerworkings/shModelRgc.m`
    (raw fourPop channel builder) is unchanged and still used directly by a
    few `show/` scripts for channel visualization.
- **Increment 3d — TODO.** Measure *intrinsic* DS of the biological front-end by
  wiring V1 neurons directly from ON/OFF (Chariker), not by fitting to legacy --
  fitting to legacy inherits legacy's DS and does not test the mechanism. Calibrate
  kernels/offset to a frame rate and to Kling (2020).

**(1) Prototype the ON/OFF DS mechanism — DONE (2026-07-10).** See §2.7 and
`explore/prototypeOnOffDelayDS.m`. Conclusion: a pure delay → narrowband (high-TF)
DS; a constant-phase (quadrature) ON/OFF kernel difference → broadband DS. Both
the temporal difference and the spatial offset are required. Remaining refinement
for the real implementation: use a *causal* quadrature-approximating ON kernel
(Chariker Mechanism #2), and calibrate to a frame rate.

**Guardrails:**
- Keep the legacy (RGC-disabled) path as the oracle. The derivative preset must
  still reproduce it to ~1e-16 at `nScales = 1`. Run `tests/runAllTests.m`.
- Convert relative timing to frames using the model's frame duration (TODO:
  confirm the intended frame rate — needed to place Chariker's 10 ms / Kling's
  time-to-peak on the model's frame axis).

## 5. Environment / workflow notes (READ if on a new machine)

- **MATLAB runs headless via the MATLAB MCP server** (`mcp__MATLAB__run_matlab_file`
  / `evaluate_matlab_code`). Figure windows are suppressed unless
  `DefaultFigureVisible` is `on`. On *this* (desktop) machine we fixed it with a
  `startup.m` in `userpath` (`/Users/jaw288/repos/Code`) that runs
  `set(0,'DefaultFigureVisible','on')`. **That startup.m is outside the repo and
  will not transfer.** On the laptop, either replicate it or run
  `set(0,'DefaultFigureVisible','on')` at the start of a session. Check with
  `feature('ShowFigureWindows')` (should be 1) and `get(0,'DefaultFigureVisible')`.
- The `explore/` scripts are self-locating (they `addpath(genpath(repoRoot))`
  from their own path) and show figures directly; they also export PNGs to
  `tempdir` for the record.
- Do **not** treat `explainV1RFs.m` (untracked) as authoritative — the user
  confirmed it is scratch/noodling, not how the code works.
